  Abstract                 = {Feature Models (FMs) are a popular formalism for modelling and reasoning about commonality and variability of a system. In essence, FMs aim to define a set of valid combinations of features, also called configurations. In this paper, we tackle the problem of synthesising an FM from a set of configurations. The main challenge is that numerous candidate FMs can be extracted from the same input configurations, yet only a few of them are meaningful and maintainable. We first characterise the different meanings of FMs and identify the key properties allowing to discriminate between them. We then develop a generic synthesis procedure capable of restituting the intended meanings of FMs based on inferred or user-specified knowledge. Using k-tool support, we show how the integration of knowledge into FM synthesis can be realized in different practical application scenarios that involve reverse engineering and maintaining FMs.},

  Abstract                 = {Variability management is a key issue when building and evolving software-intensive systems, making it possible to extend, configure, customize and adapt such systems to customers' needs and specific deployment contexts. A wide form of variability can be found in extensible software systems, typically built on top of plugin-based architectures that offer a (large) number of configuration options through plugins. In an ideal world, a software architect should be able to generate a system variant on-demand, corresponding to a particular assembly of plugins. To this end, the variation points and constraints between architectural elements should be properly modeled and maintained over time (i.e., for each version of an architecture). A crucial, yet error-prone and time-consuming, task for a software architect is to build an accurate representation of the variability of an architecture, in order to prevent unsafe architectural variants and reach the highest possible level of flexibility. In this article, we propose a reverse engineering process for producing a variability model (i.e., a feature model) of a plugin-based architecture. We develop automated techniques to extract and combine different variability descriptions, including a hierarchical software architecture model, a plugin dependency model and the software architect knowledge. By computing and reasoning about differences between versions of architectural feature models, software architect can control both the variability extraction and evolution processes. The proposed approach has been applied to a representative, large-scale plugin-based system (FraSCAti), considering different versions of its architecture. We report on our experience in this context.},

  Abstract                 = {In product line engineering, domain analysis is the process of analyzing related products to identify their common and variable features. This process is generally carried out by experts on the basis of existing product descriptions, which are expressed in a more or less structured way. Modeling and reasoning about product descriptions are error-prone and time consuming tasks. Feature models (FMs) constitute popular means to specify product commonalities and variabilities in a compact way, and to provide automated support to the domain analysis process. This paper aims at easing the transition from product descriptions expressed in a tabular format to FMs accurately representing them. This process is parameterized through a dedicated language and high-level directives (e.g., products/features scoping). We guarantee that the resulting FM represents the set of legal feature combinations supported by the considered products and has a readable tree hierarchy together with variability information. We report on our experiments based on public data and characterize the properties of the derived FMs. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of scientific workflows is evolving toward the systematic use of service-oriented architectures, enabling the composition of dedicated and highly parameterized software services into processing pipelines. Building consistent workflows then becomes a cumbersome and error-prone activity as users cannot manage such large-scale variability. This paper presents a rigorous and tooled approach in which techniques from Software Product Line (SPL) engineering are reused and extended to manage variability in service and workflow descriptions. Composition can be facilitated while ensuring consistency. Services are organized in a rich catalog which is organized as a SPL and structured according to the common and variable concerns captured for all services. By relying on sound merging techniques on the feature models that make up the catalog, reasoning about the compatibility between connected services is made possible. Moreover, an entire workflow is then seen as a multiple SPL (i. e., a composition of several SPLs). When services are configured within, the propagation of variability choices is then automated with appropriate techniques and the user is assisted in obtaining a consistent workflow. The approach proposed is completely supported by a combination of dedicated tools and languages. Illustrations and experimental validations are provided using medical imaging pipelines, which are representative of current scientific workflows in many domains. {\copyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  Abstract                 = {A key aspect for effective variability modeling of Software Product Lines (SPL) is to harmonize the need to achieve separation of concerns with the need to satisfy consistency of requirements and constraints. Techniques for variability modeling such as feature models used together with use scenarios help to achieve separation of stakeholders' concerns but ensuring their joint consistency is largely unsupported. Therefore, inconsistent assumptions about system's expected use scenarios and the way in which they vary according to the presence or absence of features reduce the models usefulness and possibly renders invalid SPL systems. In this paper we propose an approach to check consistency - the verification of semantic relationships among the models - between features and use scenarios that realize them. The novelty of this approach is that it is specially tailored for the SPL domain and considers complex composition situations where the customization of use scenarios for specific products depends on the presence or absence of sets of features. We illustrate our approach and supporting tools using variant constructs that specify how the inclusion of sets of variable features (that refer to uncommon requirements between products of a SPL) adapt use scenarios related to other features. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Such architectures often emerge from legacy code, but, unfortunately creating feature models from large, legacy systems is a long and arduous task. We address the problem of automatic synthesis of feature models from propositional constraints. We show that this problem is NP-hard. We design efficient techniques for synthesis of models from respectively CNF and DNF formulas, showing a 10- to 1000-fold performance improvement over known techniques for realistic benchmarks. Our algorithms are the first known techniques that are efficient enough to be applied to dependencies extracted from real systems, opening new possibilities of creating reverse engineering and model management tools for variability models. We discuss several such scenarios in the paper. Copyright {\copyright} 2012 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {Context A Software Product Line is a set of software systems that are built from a common set of features. These systems are developed in a prescribed way and they can be adapted to fit the needs of customers. Feature models specify the properties of the systems that are meaningful to customers. A semantics that models the feature level has the potential to support the automatic analysis of entire software product lines. Objective The objective of this paper is to define a formal framework for Software Product Lines. This framework needs to be general enough to provide a formal semantics for existing frameworks like FODA (Feature Oriented Domain Analysis), but also to be easily adaptable to new problems. Method We define an algebraic language, called SPLA, to describe Software Product Lines. We provide the semantics for the algebra in three different ways. The approach followed to give the semantics is inspired by the semantics of process algebras. First we define an operational semantics, next a denotational semantics, and finally an axiomatic semantics. We also have defined a representation of the algebra into propositional logic. Results We prove that the three semantics are equivalent. We also show how FODA diagrams can be automatically translated into SPLA. Furthermore, we have developed our tool, called AT, that implements the formal framework presented in this paper. This tool uses a SAT-solver to check the satisfiability of an SPL. Conclusion This paper defines a general formal framework for software product lines. We have defined three different semantics that are equivalent; this means that depending on the context we can choose the most convenient approach: operational, denotational or axiomatic. The framework is flexible enough because it is closely related to process algebras. Process algebras are a well-known paradigm for which many extensions have been defined. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern software systems are constantly increasing in complexity and supporting the rapid prototyping of such systems has become crucial to check the feasibility of extensions and optimizations, thereby reducing risks and, consequently, the cost of development. As modern software systems are also expected to be reused, extended, and adapted over a much longer lifetime than ever before, ensuring the maintainability of such systems is equally gaining relevance. In this paper, we present the development, optimization and maintenance of MoSo-PoLiTe, a framework for Software Product Line (SPL) testing, as a novel case study for rapid prototyping via metamodelling and programmed graph transformations. The first part of the case study evaluates the use of programmed graph transformations for optimizing an existing, hand-written system (MoSo-PoLiTe) via rapid prototyping of various strategies. In the second part, we present a complete re-engineering of the hand-written system with programmed graph transformations and provide a critical comparison of both implementations.Our results and conclusions indicate that metamodelling and programmed graph transformation are not only suitable techniques for rapid prototyping, but also lead to more maintainable systems. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Feature interactions-- situations in which the combination of features leads to emergent and possibly critical behavior --are a major source of failures in software product lines. We explore how feature-aware verification can improve the automatic detection of feature interactions in software product lines. Feature-aware verification uses product-line-verification techniques and supports the specification of feature properties along with the features in separate and composable units. It integrates the technique of variability encoding to verify a product line without generating and checking a possibly exponential number of feature combinations. We developed the tool suite SPLVERIFIER for feature-aware verification, which is based on standard model-checking technology. We applied it to an e-mail system that incorporates domain knowledge of AT&T. We found that feature interactions can be detected automatically based on specifications that have only local knowledge.},

  Abstract                 = {Requirements engineering is recognized as a critical stage in software development lifecycle. Given the nature of Software Product Lines (SPL), the importance of requirements engineering is more pronounced as SPLs pose more complex challenges than development of a 'single' product. Several methods have been proposed in the literature, which encompass activities for capturing requirements, their variability and commonality. To investigate the maturity and effectiveness of the current requirements engineering approaches in software product lines, we develop an evaluation framework containing a set of evaluation criteria and assess feature oriented requirements engineering methods based on the proposed criteria. As a result of this initial study, we find out the majority of approaches lacks proper techniques for supporting the validation of family requirements models as well as dealing with delta requirements. Additionally, capturing stakeholders' preferences and applying them during the course of software feature configuration have not been taken into account and addressed in the proposed approaches.

  Abstract                 = {A software product line is a unified representation of a set of conceptually similar software systems that share many common features and satisfy the requirements of a particular domain. Within the context of software product lines, feature models are tree-like structures that are widely used for modeling and representing the inherent commonality and variability of software product lines. Given the fact that many different software systems can be spawned from a single software product line, it can be anticipated that a low-quality design can ripple through to many spawned software systems. Therefore, the need for early indicators of external quality attributes is recognized in order to avoid the implications of defective and low-quality design during the late stages of production. In this paper, we propose a set of structural metrics for software product line feature models and theoretically validate them using valid measurement-theoretic principles. Further, we investigate through controlled experimentation whether these structural metrics can be good predictors (early indicators) of the three main subcharacteristics of maintainability: analyzability, changeability, and understandability. More specifically, a four-step analysis is conducted: (1) investigating whether feature model structural metrics are correlated with feature model maintainability through the employment of classical statistical correlation techniques; (2) understanding how well each of the structural metrics can serve as discriminatory references for maintainability; (3) identifying the sufficient set of structural metrics for evaluating each of the subcharacteristics of maintainability; and (4) evaluating how well different prediction models based on the proposed structural metrics can perform in indicating the maintainability of a feature model. Results obtained from the controlled experiment support the idea that useful prediction models can be built for the purpose of evaluating feature model maintainability using early structural metrics. Some of the structural metrics show significant correlation with the subjective perception of the subjects about the maintainability of the feature models. {\copyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Requirements for implemented system can be extracted and reused for a production of a new similar system. Extraction of common and variable features from requirements leverages the benefits of the software product lines engineering (SPLE). Although various approaches have been proposed in feature extractions from natural language (NL) requirements, no related literature review has been published to date for this topic. This paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of the state-of-the-art approaches in feature extractions from NL requirements for reuse in SPLE. We have included 13 studies in our synthesis of evidence and the results showed that hybrid natural language processing approaches were found to be in common for overall feature extraction process. A mixture of automated and semi-automated feature clustering approaches from data mining and information retrieval were also used to group common features, with only some approaches coming with support tools. However, most of the support tools proposed in the selected studies were not made available publicly and thus making it hard for practitioners' adoption. As for the evaluation, this SLR reveals that not all studies employed software metrics as ways to validate experiments and case studies. Finally, the quality assessment conducted confirms that practitioners' guidelines were absent in the selected studies. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {In Software Product Lines (SPL), quality evaluation is a critical factor, because an error in a SPL can spread to various end products. However, it is often proved impractical to ensure the quality of all products of a given SPL both for economic reasons and the effort needed due to their large number. In this context, a strategy that can be used is to make quality assessments on the initial phases of the SPL development. This approach avoids having errors that could be propagated to the next SPL phases. So, taking into account the feature model, which is one of the most important artifacts in a SPL since its quality directly affects the quality of the SPL end products, to assure the quality of the feature model is one of the current strategies to assess the quality of a SPL. In this sense, one way to evaluate the feature model is to use measures, which could be associated with the feature model quality characteristics and their quality attributes. This paper presents a measures catalog, which can be used to support the quality evaluation of the feature model. In order to identify these measures, a systematic mapping is conducted and to validate the measures catalog, we perform a peer review with experts in software quality and SPL. Besides that, to evaluate the use of the proposed catalog, we apply the measures in three feature models in the domain of mobile applications. The results show that the proposed measures catalog can be effectively deployed to support the quality evaluation of the feature models. {\copyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

  Abstract                 = {In software product lines, feature models are the de-facto standard for representing variability as well as for configuring products. Yet, configuration relying on feature models faces two issues: i) it assumes knowledge of the underlying formalism, which may not be true for end users and ii) it does not take advantage of advanced user-interface controls, leading to usability and integration problems with other parts of the user interface. To address these issues, our research focuses on the generation of configuration interfaces based on variability models, both from the visual and behavioral perspectives. We tackle visual issues by generating abstract user-interfaces from feature models. Regarding configuration behavior, in particular the configuration sequence, we plan to use feature configuration workows, variability-aware models that exhibit similar characteristics as of task, user, discourse and business models found in the in the human-computer interaction community. This paper discusses the main challenges and possible solutions to realize our vision. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last two decades, software product lines have been used successfully in industry for building families of systems of related products, maximizing reuse, and exploiting their variable and configurable options. In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Feature modeling is widely used in software product-line engineering to capture the commonalities and variabilities within an application domain. As feature models evolve, they can become very complex with respect to the number of features and the dependencies among them, which can cause the product derivation based on feature selection to become quite time consuming and error prone. We address this problem by presenting techniques to find good feature selection sequences that are based on the number of products that contain a particular feature and the impact of a selected feature on the selection of other features. Specifically, we identify a feature selection strategy, which brings up highly selective features early for selection. By prioritizing feature selection based on the selectivity of features our technique makes the feature selection process more efficient. Moreover, our approach helps with the problem of unexpected side effects of feature selection in later stages of the selection process, which is commonly considered a difficult problem. We have run our algorithm on the e-Shop and Berkeley DB feature models and also on some automatically generated feature models. The evaluation results demonstrate that our techniques can shorten the product derivation processes significantly. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {In the scientific community, feature models are the de-facto standard for representing variability in software product line engineering. This is different from industrial settings where they appear to be used much less frequently. We and other authors found that in a number of cases, they lack concision, naturalness and expressiveness. This is confirmed by industrial experience. When modelling variability, an efficient tool for making models intuitive and concise are feature attributes. Yet, the semantics of feature models with attributes is not well understood and most existing notations do not support them at all. Furthermore, the graphical nature of feature models' syntax also appears to be a barrier to industrial adoption, both psychological and rational. Existing tool support for graphical feature models is lacking or inadequate, and inferior in many regards to tool support for text-based formats. To overcome these shortcomings, we designed TVL, a text-based feature modelling language. In terms of expressiveness, TVL subsumes most existing dialects. The main goal of designing TVL was to provide engineers with a human-readable language with a rich syntax to make modelling easy and models natural, but also with a formal semantics to avoid ambiguity and allow powerful automation. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {We study the problem of model checking software product line (SPL) behaviours against temporal properties. This is more difficult than for single systems because an SPL with n features yields up to 2n individual systems to verify. As each individual verification suffers from state explosion, it is crucial to propose efficient formalisms and heuristics.

We recently proposed featured transition systems (FTS), a compact representation for SPL behaviour, and defined algorithms for model checking FTS against linear temporal properties. Although they showed to outperform individual system verifications, they still face a state explosion problem as they enumerate and visit system states one by one.

In this paper, we tackle this latter problem by using symbolic representations of the state space. This lead us to consider computation tree logic (CTL) which is supported by the industry-strength symbolic model checker NuSMV. We first lay the foundations for symbolic SPL model checking by defining a feature-oriented version of CTL and its dedicated algorithms. We then describe an implementation that adapts the NuSMV language and tool infrastructure. Finally, we propose theoretical and empirical evaluations of our results. The benchmarks show that for certain properties, our algorithm is over a hundred times faster than model checking each system with the standard algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Variability modeling is essential for defining and managing the commonalities and variabilities in software product lines. Numerous variability modeling approaches exist today to support domain and application engineering activities. Most are based on feature modeling (FM) or decision modeling (DM), but so far no systematic comparison exists between these two classes of approaches. Over the last two decades many new features have been added to both FM and DM and it is tough to decide which approach to use for what purpose. This paper clarifies the relation between FM and DM. We aim to systematize the research field of variability modeling and to explore potential synergies. We compare multiple aspects of FM and DM ranging from historical origins and rationale, through syntactic and semantic richness, to tool support, identifying commonalities and differences. We hope that this effort will improve the understanding of the range of approaches to variability modeling by discussing the possible variations. This will provide insights to users considering adopting variability modeling in practice and to designers of new languages, such as the new OMG Common Variability Language. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {A key aspect in any process-oriented organisation is the evaluation of process performance for the achievement of its strategic and operational goals. Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) are a key asset to carry out this evaluation, and, therefore, having an appropriate definition of these PPIs is crucial. After a careful review of the literature related and a study of the current picture in different real organisations, we conclude that there not exists any proposal that allows to define PPIs in a way that is unambiguous and highly expressive, understandable by technical and non-technical users and traceable with the Business Process (BP). In addition, like other activities carried out during the BP lifecycle, the management of PPIs is considered time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore, providing an automated support for them is very appealing from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose the PPINOT metamodel, which allows such an advanced definition of PPIs and is independent of the language used to model the business process. Furthermore, we provide an automatic semantic mapping from the metamodel to Description Logics (DL) that allows the implementation of design-time analysis operations in such a way that DL reasoners' facilities can be leveraged. These operations provide information that can assist process analysts in the definition and instrumentation of PPIs. Finally, to validate the usefulness of our proposal, we have used the PPINOT metamodel at the core of a software tool called the PPINOT Tool Suite and we have applied it in several real scenarios. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {A software product line (SPL) is a set of software systems that have a particular set of common features and that satisfy the needs of a particular market segment or mission. Feature modeling is one of the key activities involved in the design of SPLs. The feature diagram produced in this activity captures the commonalities and variabilities of SPLs. In some complex domains (e.g.; ubiquitous computing, autonomic systems and context-aware computing), it is difficult to foresee all functionalities and variabilities a specific SPL may require. Thus, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) bind variation points at runtime to adapt to fluctuations in user needs as well as to adapt to changes in the environment. In this context, relying on formal representations of feature models is important to allow them to be automatically analyzed during system execution. Among the mechanisms used for representing and analyzing feature models, description logic (DL) based approaches demand to be better investigated in DSPLs since it provides capabilities, such as automated inconsistency detection, reasoning efficiency, scalability and expressivity. Ontology is the most common way to represent feature models knowledge based on DL reasoners. Previous works conceived ontologies for feature modeling either based on OWL classes and properties or based on OWL individuals. However, considering change or evolution scenarios of feature models, we need to compare whether a class-based or an individual-based feature modeling style is recommended to describe feature models to support SPLs, and especially its capabilities to deal with changes in feature models, as required by DSPLs. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to empirically compare two approaches based on each one of these modeling styles in several changing scenarios (e.g.; add/remove mandatory feature, add/remove optional feature and so on). We measure time to perform changes, structural impact of changes (flexibility) and correctness for performing changes in our experiment. Our results indicate that using OWL individuals requires less time to change and is more flexible than using OWL classes and properties. These results provide insightful assumptions towards the definition of an approach relying on reasoning capabilities of ontologies that can effectively support products reconfiguration in the context of DSPL. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {In industrial settings, products are rarely developed by one organization alone. Software vendors and suppliers typically maintain their own product lines, which can contribute to a larger (multi) product line. The teams involved often use different approaches and tools to manage the variability of their systems. It is unrealistic to assume that all participating units can use a standardized and prescribed variability modeling technique. The configuration of products based on several models in different notations and with different semantics is not well supported by existing approaches. In this paper we present an integrative approach that provides a unified perspective to users configuring products in multi product line environments, regardless of the different modeling methods and tools used internally. We also present a technical infrastructure and a prototypic implementation based on Web Services. We show the feasibility of the approach and its implementation by using it with two different variability modeling approaches (one feature-based and one decision-oriented approach) on an example derived from industrial experience. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

The paper provides four contributions to the study of model-driven configuration of cloud auto-scaling infrastructure by (1) explaining how virtual machine configurations can be captured in feature models, (2) describing how these models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) for configuration and energy consumption optimization, (3) showing how optimal auto-scaling configurations can be derived from these CSPs with a constraint solver, and (4) presenting a case-study showing the energy consumption/cost reduction produced by this model-driven approach},

The purpose is to present an industrial context that requires the adoption of a product line approach and of variability modeling techniques, outside of a pure-software domain. At Renault, the interest is in identifying variations and reuse opportunities early in the product development cycle, as well as in preparing vehicle configuration specifications during the systems engineering process. This would lead to lowering the engineering effort and to higher quality and confidence in carry-over and carry across based solutions. We advocate for a tight integration of variability management with the model based systems engineering approach, which needs to address methodological support, modeling techniques and efficient tools for interactive configuration, adapted for engineering activities.},

  Abstract                 = {Software product line (SPL) engineering has proven to improve software quality and shorten development cycles, cost and time. In product line engineering, product derivation is concerned with the realization of the variability at the implementation level. However, the majority of research works focuses on instantiating the variants selected in the final product, while the derivation at the architecture level has been poorly explored. As product line engineers often customize the product architecture by hand during the application engineering phase, the derivation and customization processes of the product line architecture (PLA) might be in some cases error-prone. Consequently, in this research we present an Ontology-based product Architecture Derivation (OntoAD) framework which automates the derivation of product-specific architectures from an SPL architecture. Our solution uses a language-independent model to specify the product line architecture and a model-driven engineering approach for architecture derivation activities. We use an ontology formalism to reason about the automatic generation of model-to-model transformation rules based on the selection of features and we illustrate our approach using a voice over IP motivating example. Finally, we report results about scalability and performance regarding the size of the variability model. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

Some authors report on variability models specifying several thousands of variabilities. However, traditional variability modeling approaches do not seem to scale adequately to cope with size and complexity of such models. Recently, textual variability modeling languages have been advocated as one scalable solution. In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of the capabilities of current textual variability modeling languages, in particular regarding variability management in the large. Towards this aim, we define a classification schema consisting of five dimensions, classify ten different textual variability modeling languages using the classification schema and provide an analysis. In summary, some textual variability modeling languages go beyond textual representations of traditional variability modeling approaches and provide sophisticated modeling concepts and constraint languages. Three textual variability modeling approaches already support mechanisms for large-scale variability modeling such as model composition, modularization, or evolution support.},

  Abstract                 = {A software product line is an engineering approach to efficient development of software product portfolios. Key to the success of the approach is to identify the common and variable features of the products and the interdependencies between them, which are usually modeled using feature models. Implicitly, such models also include valuable information that can be used by economic models to estimate the payoffs of a product line. Unfortunately, as product lines grow, analyzing large feature models manually becomes impracticable. This paper proposes an algorithm to compute the total number of products that a feature model represents and, for each feature, the number of products that implement it. The inference of both parameters is helpful to describe the standardization/parameterization balance of a product line, detect scope flaws, assess the product line incremental development, and improve the accuracy of economic models. The paper reports experimental evidence that our algorithm has better runtime performance than existing alternative approaches. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Context Advances in customization have highlighted the need for tools supporting variable content document management and generation in many domains. Current tools allow the generation of highly customized documents that are variable in both content and layout. However, most frameworks are technology-oriented, and their use requires advanced skills in implementation-related tools, which means their use by end users (i.e. document designers) is severely limited. Objective Starting from past and current trends for customized document authoring, our goal is to provide a document generation alternative in which variants are specified at a high level of abstraction and content reuse can be maximized in high variability scenarios. Method Based on our experience in Document Engineering, we identified areas in the variable content document management and generation field open to further improvement. We first classified the primary sources of variability in document composition processes and then developed a methodology, which we called DPL - based on Software Product Lines principles - to support document generation in high variability scenarios. Results In order to validate the applicability of our methodology we implemented a tool - DPLfw - to carry out DPL processes. After using this in different scenarios, we compared our proposal with other state-of-the-art tools for variable content document management and generation. Conclusion The DPLfw showed a good capacity for the automatic generation of variable content documents equal to or in some cases surpassing other currently available approaches. To the best of our knowledge, DPLfw is the only framework that combines variable content and document workflow facilities, easing the generation of variable content documents in which multiple actors play different roles. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Feature models originating from Software Product Line Engineering are a well-known approach to variability modeling. In many situations, the variability does not apply only on features but also on the number of times these features can be cloned. In such a case, cardinality-based feature models are used to specify the number of clones for a given feature. Although previous works already investigated approaches for feature modeling with cardinality, there is still a lack of support for constraints in the presence of clones. To overcome this limitation, we present an abstract model to define constraints in cardinality-based feature models and propose a formal semantics for this kind of constraints. We illustrate the practical usage of our approach with examples from our recent experiences on cloud computing platform configuration.},

These dependencies and constraints describe the possible number of variants of the program: A valid feature configuration generates a specific variant with unique behavior. Feature-Oriented Programming is used to implement features as program units. This paper introduces rbFeatures, a feature-oriented programming language implemented on top of the dynamic programming language Ruby. With rbFeatures, programmers use software product lines, variants, and features as first-class entities. This allows several runtime reflection and modification capabilities, including the extension of the product line with new features and the provision of multiple variants. The paper gives a broad overview to the implementation and application of rbFeatures. We explain how features as first-class entities are designed and implemented, and discuss how the semantics of features are carefully added to Ruby programs. We show two case studies: The expression product line, a common example in feature-oriented programming, and a web application. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: In industrial settings products are developed by more than one organization. Software vendors and suppliers commonly typically maintain their own product lines, which contribute to a larger (multi) product line or software ecosystem. It is unrealistic to assume that the participating organizations will agree on using a specific variability modeling technique - they will rather use different approaches and tools to manage the variability of their systems. Objective: We aim to support product configuration in software ecosystems based on several variability models with different semantics that have been created using different notations. Method: We present an integrative approach that provides a unified perspective to users configuring products in multi product line environments, regardless of the different modeling methods and tools used internally. We also present a technical infrastructure and a prototype implementation based on web services. Results: We show the feasibility of the approach and its implementation by using it with the three most widespread types of variability modeling approaches in the product line community, i.e., feature-based, OVM-style, and decision-oriented modeling. To demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of our approach, we present an example derived from industrial experience in enterprise resource planning. We further applied the approach to support the configuration of privacy settings in the Android ecosystem based on multiple variability models. We also evaluated the performance of different model enactment strategies used in our approach. Conclusions: Tools and techniques allowing stakeholders to handle variability in a uniform manner can considerably foster the initiation and growth of software ecosystems from the perspective of software reuse and configuration. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Context: Variability (i.e., the ability of software systems or artifacts to be adjusted for different contexts) became a key property of many systems. Objective: We analyze existing research on variability in software systems. We investigate variability handling in major software engineering phases (e.g., requirements engineering, architecting). Method: We performed a systematic literature review. A manual search covered 13 premium software engineering journals and 18 premium conferences, resulting in 15,430 papers searched and 196 papers considered for analysis. To improve reliability and to increase reproducibility, we complemented the manual search with a targeted automated search. Results: Software quality attributes have not received much attention in the context of variability. Variability is studied in all software engineering phases, but testing is underrepresented. Data to motivate the applicability of current approaches are often insufficient; research designs are vaguely described. Conclusions: Based on our findings we propose dimensions of variability in software engineering. This empirically grounded classification provides a step towards a unifying, integrated perspective of variability in software systems, spanning across disparate or loosely coupled research themes in the software engineering community. Finally, we provide recommendations to bridge the gap between research and practice and point to opportunities for future research. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

FMs may evolve, for instance, during refactoring activities. Developers may use a catalog of refactorings as support. However, the catalog is incomplete in principle. Additionally, it is non-trivial to propose correct refactorings. To our knowledge, no previous analysis technique for FMs is used for checking properties of general FM refactorings (a transformation that can be applied to a number of FMs) containing a representative number of features. We propose an efficient encoding of FMs in the Alloy formal specification language. Based on this encoding, we show how the Alloy Analyzer tool, which performs analysis on Alloy models, can be used to automatically check whether encoded general and specific FM refactorings are correct. Our approach can analyze general transformations automatically to a significant scale in a few seconds. In order to evaluate the analysis performance of our encoding, we evaluated in automatically generated FMs ranging from 500 to 2,000 features. Furthermore, we analyze the soundness of general transformations. {\copyright} J.UCS.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: During the definition of software product lines (SPLs) it is necessary to choose the components that appropriately fulfil a product's intended functionalities, including its quality requirements (i.e., security, performance, scalability). The selection of the appropriate set of assets from many possible combinations is usually done manually, turning this process into a complex, time-consuming, and error-prone task. Objective: Our main objective is to determine whether, with the use of modeling tools, we can simplify and automate the definition process of a SPL, improving the selection process of reusable assets. Method: We developed a model-driven strategy based on the identification of critical points (sensitivity points) inside the SPL architecture. This strategy automatically selects the components that appropriately match the product's functional and quality requirements. We validated our approach experimenting with different real configuration and derivation scenarios in a mobile healthcare SPL where we have worked during the last three years. Results: Through our SPL experiment, we established that our approach improved in nearly 98% the selection of reusable assets when compared with the unassisted analysis selection. However, using our approach there is an increment in the time required for the configuration corresponding to the learning curve of the proposed tools. Conclusion: We can conclude that our domain-specific modeling approach significantly improves the software architect's decision making when selecting the most suitable combinations of reusable components in the context of a SPL. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Software product line (SPL) techniques handle the construction of customized systems. One of the most common representations of the decisions a customer can make in SPLs is feature models (FMs). An FM represents the relationships among common and variable features in an SPL. Features are a representation of the characteristics in a system that are relevant to customers. FMs are subject to change since the set of features and their relationships can change along an SPL lifecycle. Due to this evolution, the consistency of FMs may be compromised. There exist some approaches to detect and explain inconsistencies in FMs, however this process can take a long time for large FMs. In this paper we present a complementary approach to dealing with inconsistencies in FM evolution scenarios that improves the performance for existing approaches reducing the impact of change to the smallest part of an FM that changes. To achieve our goal, we formalize FMs from an ontological perspective and define constraints that must be satisfied in FMs to be consistent. We define a set of primitive operations that modify FMs and which are responsible for the FM evolution, analyzing their impact on the FM consistency. We propose a set of predefined strategies to keep the consistency for error-prone operations. As a proof-of-concept we present the results of our experiments, where we check for the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in FMs with thousands of features. Although our approach is limited by the kinds of consistency constraints and the primitive operations we define, the experiments present a significant improvement in performance results in those cases where they are applicable. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {Combinatorial Interaction Testing has shown great potential for effectively testing Software Product Lines (SPLs). An important part of this type of testing is determining a subset of SPL products in which interaction errors are more likely to occur. Such sets of products are obtained by computing a so called t-wise Covering Array (tCA), whose computation is known to be NP-complete. Recently, the ICPL algorithm has been proposed to compute these covering arrays. In this research-in-progress paper, we propose a set of rules that exploit basic feature model knowledge to reduce the number of elements (i.e. t-sets) required by ICPL without weakening the strength of the generated arrays. We carried out a comparison of runtime performance that shows a significant reduction of the needed execution time for the majority of our SPL case studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Software product lines rely on developing reusable artifacts and defining their variability in models to support and accelerate the derivation of individual products. A major challenge in product lines is the continuous evolution of both the reusable artifacts and derived products. Products that have been derived from a product line have to be updated regularly, e. g., after bugfixes or the development of new features. Changes to reusable artifacts and variability models have to be propagated to derived products. The aim of our research is to provide automated support for the evolution of products derived from product lines by capturing and replaying configuration decisions. Our PUPLE (Product Updates in Product Line Engineering) approach supports updating derived products after changes to the product line they have been derived from. It exploits the structure of variability models and uses change-tracking data to minimize user intervention. The paper first explores how different types of product line changes influence the derived products. It then presents extensions to our decision-oriented product line approach DOPLER to support product line evolution. We evaluate the feasibility of the PUPLE approach with evolution tasks that were performed by engineers of an industry partner on a product line of an Eclipse-based tool suite with six derived products. We conclude with lessons learned and limitations of our approach. {\copyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  Abstract                 = {Large Software Product Lines (SPLs) are common in industry, thus introducing the need of practical solutions to test them. To this end, t-wise can help to drastically reduce the number of product configurations to test. Current t-wise approaches for SPLs are restricted to small values of t. In addition, these techniques fail at providing means to finely control the configuration process. In view of this, means for automatically generating and prioritizing product configurations for large SPLs are required. This paper proposes (a) a search-based approach capable of generating product configurations for large SPLs, forming a scalable and flexible alternative to current techniques and (b) prioritization algorithms for any set of product configurations. Both these techniques employ a similarity heuristic. The ability of the proposed techniques is assessed in an empirical study through a comparison with state of the art tools. The comparison focuses on both the product configuration generation and the prioritization aspects. The results demonstrate that existing t-wise tools and prioritization techniques fail to handle large SPLs. On the contrary, the proposed techniques are both effective and scalable. Additionally, the experiments show that the similarity heuristic can be used as a viable alternative to t-wise. {\copyright} 1976-2012 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Software Products Lines (SPLs) are families of products sharing common assets representing code or functionalities of a software product. These assets are represented as features, usually organized into Feature Models (FMs) from which the user can configure software products. Generally, few features are sufficient to allow configuring millions of software products. As a result, selecting the products matching given testing objectives is a difficult problem. The testing process usually involves multiple and potentially conflicting testing objectives to fulfill, e.g. maximizing the number of optional features to test while at the same time both minimizing the number of products and minimizing the cost of testing them. However, most approaches for generating products usually target a single objective, like testing the maximum amount of feature interactions. While focusing on one objective may be sufficient in certain cases, this practice does not reflect real-life testing situations. The present paper proposes a genetic algorithm to handle multiple conflicting objectives in test generation for SPLs. Experiments conducted on FMs of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness, feasibility and practicality of the introduced approach. {\copyright} 2013 ACM.},

COPLIMO is an economic model that relies on COCOMO II to estimate the benefits of adopting a product line approach compared to developing the products one by one. Although COPLIMO is an ideal economic model to support decision making on the incremental development of a product line, it makes some simplifying assumptions that may produce high distortions in the estimates (e.g.; COPLIMO takes for granted that all the products have the same size). This paper proposes a COPLIMO reformulation that avoids such assumptions and, consequently, improves the accuracy of the estimates. To support our proposal, we present an algorithm that infers the additional information that our COPLIMO reformulation requires from feature diagrams, which is a widespread notation to model the domain of a product line. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Key to the success of this approach is to correctly scope the domain of the SPL, identifying the common and variable features of the products and the interdependencies between features. In this study, the authors show how the commonality of a feature (i.e. the reuse ratio of the feature among the products) can be used to detect scope flaws in the early stages of development. SPL domains are usually modelled by means of feature diagrams following the feature-oriented domain analysis (FODA) notation. The authors extend classical FODA trees with unrestricted cardinalities, and present an algorithm to compute the number of products modelled by a feature diagram and the commonality of the features. Finally, the authors compare the performance of their algorithm with two other approaches built on top of boolean logic satisfiability (SAT)-solver technology such as cachet and relsat. {\copyright} 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

Surprisingly though, it seems that very few reports on the use of feature diagrams in practice are available. To test this claim, we started a systematic review of such reports. In the collected material, we tried to identify positive and negative feedback on the use of feature diagrams. In this paper, we present the first results of this work in progress and discuss the opportunity of extending it to a fully systematic review on a wider scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Feature diagrams have become commonplace in software product line engineering as a means to document variability early in the life cycle. Over the years, their application has also been extended to assist stakeholders in the configuration of software products. However, existing feature-based configuration techniques offer little support for tailoring configuration views to the profiles of the various stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, yet formal and flexible, mechanism to leverage multidimensional separation of concerns in feature-based configuration. We propose a technique to specify concerns in feature diagrams and to generate automatically concern-specific configuration views. Three alternative visualisations are proposed. Our contributions are motivated and illustrated through excerpts from a real web-based meeting management application which was also used for a preliminary evaluation. We also report on the progress made in the development of a tool supporting multi-view feature-based configuration. {\copyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  Abstract                 = {The need for flexible customization of large feature-rich software systems, according to requirements of various stakeholders, has become an important problem in software development. Among the many software engineering approaches dealing with variability management, the notion of Software Product Line (SPL) has emerged as a major unifying concept. Drawing from established disciplines of manufacturing, SPL approaches aim to design repertoires of software artifacts, from which customized software systems for specific stakeholder requirements can be developed. A major difficulty SPL approaches attempt to address is the modularization of software artifacts, which reconciles the user's needs for certain features and the development and technical constraints. Towards this end, many SPL approaches use feature diagrams to describe possible configurations of a feature set. There have been several proposals for feature diagram languages with varying degrees of expressiveness, intuitiveness, and precision. However, these feature diagram languages have limited scalability when applied to realistic software systems. This article provides a systematic survey of various concerns of feature diagrams and ways in which concerns have been separated. The survey shows how the uncertainty in the purpose of feature diagram languages creates both conceptual and practical limitations to scalability of those languages. {\copyright} 2013 ACM.},

Although several approaches reported in the literature addressed this issue, complex feature-attribute and attribute-attribute relationships in extended feature models were not handled effectively. In this article, we introduce a mapping from extended feature models to constraint logic programming over finite domains. This mapping is used to translate basic, cardinality-based, and extended feature models, which may include complex feature-feature, feature-attribute and attribute-attribute cross-tree relationships, into constraint logic programs. It thus enables use of off-the-shelf constraint solvers for the automated analysis of extended feature models involving such complex relationships. We also briefly discuss the ramifications of including feature-attribute relationships in operations of analysis. We believe that this proposal will be effective for further leveraging of constraint logic programming for automated analysis of feature models. {\copyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

However, adopting a product-line approach poses a major challenge and significant risks, since typically legacy code must be migrated toward a product line. Our aim is to lower the adoption barrier by providing semi-automatic tool support-called variability mining-to support developers in locating, documenting, and extracting implementations of product-line features from legacy code. Variability mining combines prior work on concern location, reverse engineering, and variability-aware type systems, but is tailored specifically for the use in product lines. Our work pursues three technical goals: (1) we provide a consistency indicator based on a variability-aware type system, (2) we mine features at a fine level of granularity, and (3) we exploit domain knowledge about the relationship between features when available. With a quantitative study, we demonstrate that variability mining can efficiently support developers in locating features. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

scale. In this research-in-progress report, we propose a systematic
approach aiming at efficient and scalable prediction
of quality attributes of products. To this end, we establish
predictors for certain categories of quality attributes (e.g., a
predictor for high memory consumption) based on software
and network measures, and receiver operating characteristic
analysis. We use these predictors to guide a sampling
process that takes the assets of a product line as input and
determines the products that fall into the category denoted
by the given predictor (e.g., products with high memory
consumption). We propose to use predictors to make the
process of finding “acceptable” products more efficient. We
discuss and compare several strategies to incorporate predictors
in the sampling process.},

This article presents a systematic review of domain analysis tools that aims at finding out how the available tools offer support to the process. As a result, the review identified that these tools are usually focused on supporting only one process and there are still gaps in the complete process support. Furthermore, the results can provide insights for new research in the domain engineering area for investigating and defining new tools, and the study also aids in the identification of companies’ needs for a domain analysis tool.},

More concretely, the SBSE techniques that have been used and at what stage of the SPL life cycle, the type of case studies employed and their empirical analysis, and the fora where the research has been published. Method A systematic mapping study was conducted with five research questions and assessed 77 publications from 2001, when the term SBSE was coined, until 2014. Results The most common application of SBSE techniques found was testing followed by product configuration, with genetic algorithms and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms being the two most commonly used techniques. Our study identified the need to improve the robustness of the empirical evaluation of existing research, a lack of extensive and robust tool support, and multiple avenues worthy of further investigation. Conclusions Our study attested the great synergy existing between both fields, corroborated the increasing and ongoing interest in research on the subject, and revealed challenging open research questions. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Successful software evolves from a single system by adding and changing functionality to keep up with users' demands and to cater to their similar and different requirements. Nowadays it is a common practice to offer a system in many variants such as community, professional, or academic editions. Each variant provides different functionality described in terms of features. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is an effective software development paradigm for this scenario. At the core of SPLE is variability modelling whose goal is to represent the combinations of features that distinguish the system variants using feature models, the de facto standard for such task. As SPLE practices are becoming more pervasive, reverse engineering feature models from the feature descriptions of each individual variant has become an active research subject. In this paper we evaluated, for this reverse engineering task, three standard search based techniques (evolutionary algorithms, hill climbing, and random search) with two objective functions on 74 SPLs. We compared their performance using precision and recall, and found a clear trade-off between these two metrics which we further reified into a third objective function based on Fβ, an information retrieval measure, that showed a clear performance improvement. We believe that this work sheds light on the great potential of search-based techniques for SPLE tasks. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {More and more frequently successful software systems need to evolve into families of systems, known as Software Product Lines (SPLs), to be able to cater to the different functionality requirements demanded by different customers while at the same time aiming to exploit as much common functionality as possible. As a first step, this evolution demands a clear understanding of how the functional requirements map into the features of the original system. Using this knowledge, features can be refactored so that they are reused for building the new systems of the evolved SPL. In this paper we present our experience in refactoring features based on the requirements specifications of a small and a medium size systems. Our work identified eight refactoring patterns that describe how to extract the elements of features which were subsequently implemented using Feature Oriented Software Development (FOSD) a novel modularization paradigm whose driving goal is to effectively modularize features for the development of variable systems. We argue that the identification of refactoring patterns are a stepping stone towards automating Feature-Oriented Refactoring, and present some open issues that should be addressed to that avail. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

There are many opportunities for economies of scope and scale in the testing activities, but techniques that can take advantage of these opportunities are still needed. Objective The objective of this study is to identify testing strategies that have the potential to achieve these economies, and to provide a synthesis of available research on SPL testing strategies, to be applied towards reaching higher defect detection rates and reduced quality assurance effort. Method We performed a literature review of two hundred seventy-six studies published from the year 1998 up to the 1st semester of 2013. We used several filters to focus the review on the most relevant studies and we give detailed analyses of the core set of studies. Results The analysis of the reported strategies comprised two fundamental aspects for software product line testing: the selection of products for testing, and the actual test of products. Our findings indicate that the literature offers a large number of techniques to cope with such aspects. However, there is a lack of reports on realistic industrial experiences, which limits the inferences that can be drawn. Conclusion This study showed a number of leveraged strategies that can support both the selection of products, and the actual testing of products. Future research should also benefit from the problems and advantages identified in this study. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPL) should ensure the correctness, completeness and consistency of its artefacts and related domain to prevent the propagation of defects in derived products. Software inspection techniques are effective in detecting defects in software artefacts and avoiding their propagation throughout the software development process. However, the results of a quasi-systematic review of the technical literature reported in this paper pointed to a lack of such techniques to support the inspection of SPL artefacts, including techniques to support the inspection of feature models (FMs) that are largely used in domain modelling. Therefore, a checklist-based inspection technique (FMCheck) has been developed to support the detection of defects on FMs. FMCheck is configurable and can be applied to the original feature model notation (the FODA approach) and its extensions, including the Odyssey-FEX notation. The inspection technique was empirically evaluated, having indicated its feasibility and effectiveness. It is possible to see that inspectors applying FMCheck to inspect FMs can be more effective than those applying ad-hoc techniques, regarding four distinct domains. {\copyright} J.UCS.},

Specifying a PL as a constraint program instead of a feature model carries out two important qualities of CP: expressiveness and direct automation. On the one hand, variables in CP can take values over boolean, integer, real or even complex domains and not only boolean values as in most PL languages such as the Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis (FODA). Specifying boolean, arithmetic, symbolic and reified constraint, provides a power of expression that spans beyond that provided by the boolean dependencies in FODA models. On the other hand, PL models expressed as constraint programs can directly be executed and analyzed by off-the-shelf solvers. This paper explores the issues of (a) how to specify a PL model using CP, including in the presence of multi-model representation, (b) how to verify PL specifications, (c) how to specify configuration requirements, and (d) how to support the product configuration activity. Tests performed on a benchmark of 50 PL models show that the approach is efficient and scales up easily to very large and complex PL specifications. Copyright {\copyright} 2012, IGI Global.},

  Abstract                 = {Software Product Lines is a contemporary approach to software development that exploits the similarities and differences within a family of systems in a particular domain of interest in order to provide a common infrastructure for deriving members of this family in a timely fashion, with high-quality standards, and at lower costs. In Software Product Lines, feature-based product configuration is the process of selecting the desired features for a given software product from a repository of features called a feature model. This process is usually carried out collaboratively by people with distinct skills and interests called stakeholders. Collaboration benefits stakeholders by allowing them to directly intervene in the configuration process. However, collaboration also raises an important side effect, i.e., the need of stakeholders to cope with decision conflicts. Conflicts arise when decisions that are locally consistent cannot be applied globally because they violate one or more constraints in the feature model. Unfortunately, current product configuration systems are typically single-user-based in the sense that they do not provide means to coordinate concurrent decision-making on the feature model. As a consequence, configuration is carried out by a single person that is in charge of representing the interests of all stakeholders and managing decision conflicts on their own. This results in an error-prone and time-consuming process that requires past decisions to be revisited continuously either to correct misinterpreted stakeholder requirements or to handle decision conflicts. Yet another challenging issue related to configuration problems is the typically high computational cost of configuration algorithms. In fact, these algorithms frequently fall into the category of NP-hard and thus can become intractable in practice. In this paper, our goal is two-fold. First, we revisit our work on Collaborative Product Configuration (CPC) in which we proposed an approach to describe and validate collaborative configuration scenarios. We discuss how collaborative configuration can be described in terms of a workflow-like plan that safely guides stakeholders during the configuration process. Second, we propose a preliminary set of reasoning algorithms tailored to the feature modelling domain that can be used to provide automated support for product configuration. In addition, we compare empirically the performance of the proposed algorithms to that of a general-purpose solution. We hope that the insights provided in this paper will encourage other researchers to develop new algorithms in the near future. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {In embedded systems in general and in automotive systems in particular the systematic reuse of existing assets is crucial. Moreover, companies in these domains often offer whole families of similar products. Hence, the application of product line engineering seems to be an obvious option.
However, current products have reached a complexity level where management of products within a product line cannot be handled with current techniques and tools (e.g. Matlab/Simulink) alone. To sustain an efficient engineering process and to reach the required quality levels of the products, additional techniques are required.
In this paper we report on a prototypical framework for the analysis of embedded systems product lines. The techniques and tools offered by the framework were developed to support engineers in typical tasks, which occur during design, implementation, and maintenance of embedded software product lines. The techniques allow to analyse product line artefacts by transforming them into models, which are then used in an analysis process based on model transformation languages.},

  Abstract                 = {In a Software Product Line (SPL) comprising specifications
(feature sets), implementations (component sets) and traceability
between them, the definition of product is quite subtle.
Intuitively, a strong relation of implementability should
be established between implementations and specifications
due to traceability. Various notions of traceability has been
proposed in the literature : [13], [17], [8], [9]; but we found in
our experience that they do not capture all situations that
arise in practice. One example is the case where, an implementation,
due to packaging reasons, contains additional
components not required for a particular product specification.
We have defined a general notion of traceability in
order to cover such situations. Moreover, state-of-the-art
satisfiability based notions lead to products where the implementability
relation does not exist. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose a simple, set-theoretic formalism to express
the notions of traceability and implementability in a formal
manner. The subsequent definition of SPL products is used
to introduce a set of analysis problems that are either re-
finements of known problems, or are completely novel. Last
but not the least, we propose encoding the analysis problems
as Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF) constraints and
use Quantified SAT (QSAT) solvers to solve these problems
efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, the QBF encoding
is novel; we prove the correctness of our encoding and
demonstrate its practical feasibility through our prototype
implementation Software Product Line Engine (SPLE)},

  Abstract                 = {Decision models are widely used in software engineering to describe and restrict decision-making (e.g., deriving a product from a product-line). Since decisions are typically interdependent, it is often neither obvious which decisions have the most significant impact nor which decisions might ultimately conflict. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art provides little support for dealing with such situations. On the one hand, some conflicts can be avoided by providing more freedom in which order decisions are made (i.e., most important decisions first). On the other hand, conflicts are unavoidable at times, and living with conflicts may be preferable over forcing the user to fix them right away - particularly because fixing conflicts becomes easier as more is known about a user's intentions. This paper introduces the C2O (Configurator 2.0) tool for guided decision-making. The tool allows the user to answer questions in an arbitrary order - with and without the presence of inconsistencies. While giving users those freedoms, it still supports and guides them by (i) rearranging the order of questions according to their potential to minimize user input, (ii) providing guidance to avoid follow-on conflicts, and (iii) supporting users in fixing conflicts at a later time. {\copyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Not all combinations of configuration options are valid though, and constraints arise for technical or non-technical reasons. Explicitly describing these constraints in a variability model allows reasoning about the supported configurations. To automate creating variability models, we need to identify the origin of such configuration constraints. We propose an approach which uses build-time errors and a novel feature-effect heuristic to automatically extract configuration constraints from C code. We conduct an empirical study on four highly-configurable open-source systems with existing variability models having three objectives in mind: evaluate the accuracy of our approach, determine the recoverability of existing variability-model constraints using our analysis, and classify the sources of variability-model constraints. We find that both our extraction heuristics are highly accurate (93% and 77% respectively), and that we can recover 19% of the existing variability-models using our approach. However, we find that many of the remaining constraints require expert knowledge or more expensive analyses. We argue that our approach, tooling, and experimental results support researchers and practitioners working on variability model re-engineering, evolution, and consistency-checking techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Mobile applications require dynamic reconfiguration services (DRS) to self-adapt their behavior to the context changes (e.g., scarcity of resources). Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) are a well-accepted approach to manage runtime variability, by means of late binding the variation points at runtime. During the system's execution, the DRS deploys different configurations to satisfy the changing requirements according to a multiobjective criterion (e.g., insufficient battery level, requested quality of service). Search-based software engineering and, in particular, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), can generate valid configurations of a DSPL at runtime. Several approaches use MOEAs to generate optimum configurations of a Software Product Line, but none of them consider DSPLs for mobile devices. In this paper, we explore the use of MOEAs to generate at runtime optimum configurations of the DSPL according to different criteria. The optimization problem is formalized in terms of a Feature Model (FM), a variability model. We evaluate six existing MOEAs by applying them to 12 different FMs, optimizing three different objectives (usability, battery consumption and memory footprint). The results are discussed according to the particular requirements of a DRS for mobile applications, showing that PAES and NSGA-II are the most suitable algorithms for mobile environments. {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Software Product Lines (SPL) are difficult to validate due to combinatorics induced by variability, which in turn leads to combinatorial explosion of the number of derivable products. Exhaustive testing in such a large products space is hardly feasible. Hence, one possible option is to test SPLs by generating test configurations that cover all possible t feature interactions (t-wise). It dramatically reduces the number of test products while ensuring reasonable SPL coverage. In this paper, we report our experience on applying t-wise techniques for SPL with two independent toolsets developed by the authors. One focuses on generality and splits the generation problem according to strategies. The other emphasizes providing efficient generation. To evaluate the respective merits of the approaches, measures such as the number of generated test configurations and the similarity between them are provided. By applying these measures, we were able to derive useful insights for pairwise and t-wise testing of product lines. {\copyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  Abstract                 = {Software Product Lines, in conjunction with modeldriven product derivation, are successful examples for extensive automation and reuse in software development. However, often each single product requires an individual, tailored user interface of its own to achieve the desired usability. Moreover, in some cases (e.g., online shops, games) it is even mandatory that each product has an individual, unique user interface of its own. Usually, this results in manual user interface design independent from the model-driven product derivation. Consequently, each product configuration has to be mapped manually to a corresponding user interface which can become a tedious and error-prone task for large and complex product lines. This paper addresses this problem by integrating concepts from SPL product derivation and Model-based User Interface Development. This facilitates both (1) a systematic and semi-automated creation of user interfaces during product derivation while (2) still supporting for individual, creative design.},

  Abstract                 = {Software Product Lines (SPL) are an engineering technique to efficiently derive a set of similar products from a set of shared assets. In particular in conjunction with model-driven engineering, SPL engineering promises high productivity benefits. There is however, a lack of support for systematic management of SPL evolution, which is an important success factor as a product line often represents a long term investment. In this article, we present a model-driven approach for managing SPL evolution on feature level. To reduce complexity we use model fragments to cluster related elements. The relationships between these fragments are specified using feature model concepts itself leading to a specific kind of feature model called EvoFM. A configuration of EvoFM represents an evolution step and can be transformed to a concrete instance of the product line (i.e., a feature model for the corresponding point in time). Similarly, automatic transformations allow the derivation of an EvoFM from a given set of feature models. This enables retrospective analysis of historic evolution and serves as a starting point for introduction of EvoFM, e.g., to plan future evolution steps. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The efficient execution of the analysis operations depends on the selection of well-suited solver implementations.

On the other hand, feature models can be transformed into a Constraint-Satisfaction Problem (CSP) in order to use CSP solvers for validation. This paper presents a performance comparison regarding nine contemporary high-performance solvers, three for each base problem structure (BDD, CSP, and SAT). Four operations on 90 feature models are run on each solver. The results will in turn clear the way for new improvements regarding the automatic verification of software product lines, since the efficient execution of analysis operations is essential to such automatic verification approaches. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {The automated analysis of feature models (FM) is based on SAT, BDD, and CSP - known NP-complete problems. Therefore, the analysis could have an exponential worst-case execution time. However, for many practical relevant analysis cases, state-of-the-art (SOTA) analysis tools quite successfully master the problem of exponential worst-case execution time based on heuristics. So far, however, very little is known about the structure of FMs that cause the cases in which the execution time (hardness) for analyzing a given FM increases unpredictably for SOTA analysis tools. In this paper, we propose to use width measures from graph theory to characterize the structural complexity of FMs as a basis for an estimation of the hardness of analysis operations on FMs with SOTA analysis tools. We present an experiment that we use to analyze the reasonability of graph width measures as metric for the structural complexity of FMs and the hardness of FM analysis. Such a complexity metric can be used as a basis for a unified method to systematically improve SOTA analysis tools. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

In many situations, the variability does not apply only on features but also on the number of times these features can be cloned. In such a case, cardinality-based feature models are used to specify the number of clones for a given feature. Although previous works already investigated approaches for feature modeling with cardinality, there is still a lack of support for constraints in the presence of clones. To overcome this limitation, we present an abstract model to define constraints in cardinality-based feature models and propose a formal semantics for this kind of constraints. We illustrate the practical usage of our approach with examples from our recent experiences on cloud computing platform configuration. {\copyright} 2013 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {Feature models are a common way to represent variability requirements of software product lines by expressing the set of feature combinations that software products can have. Assuring quality of feature models is thus of paramount importance for assuring quality in software product line engineering. However, feature models can have several types of defects that disminish benefits of software product line engineering.Two of such defects are dead features and false optional features. Several state-of-the-art techniques identify these defects, but only few of them tackle the problem of identifying their causes. Besides, the explanations they provide are cumbersome and hard to understand by humans. In this paper, we propose an ontological rule-based approach to: (a) identify dead and false optional features; (b)identify certain causes of these defects; and (c) explain these causes in natural language helping modelers to correct found defects. We represent our approach with a feature model taken from literature. A preliminary empirical evaluation of our approach over 31 FMs shows that our proposal is effective, accurate and scalable to 150 features. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {Software product line engineering is about producing a set of similar products in a certain domain. A variability model documents the variability amongst products in a product line. The specification of variability can be extended with quality information, such as measurable quality attributes (e. g., CPU and memory consumption) and constraints on these attributes (e. g., memory consumption should be in a range of values). However, the wrong use of constraints may cause anomalies in the specification which must be detected (e. g., the model could represent no products). Furthermore, based on such quality information, it is possible to carry out quality-aware analyses, i. e., the product line engineer may want to verify whether it is possible to build a product that satisfies a desired quality. The challenge for quality-aware specification and analysis is threefold. First, there should be a way to specify quality information in variability models. Second, it should be possible to detect anomalies in the variability specification associated with quality information. Third, there should be mechanisms to verify the variability model to extract useful information, such as the possibility to build a product that fulfils certain quality conditions (e. g., is there any product that requires less than 512 MB of memory?). In this article, we present an approach for quality-aware analysis in software product lines using the orthogonal variability model (OVM) to represent variability. We propose to map variability represented in the OVM associated with quality information to a constraint satisfaction problem and to use an off-the-shelf constraint programming solver to automatically perform the verification task. To illustrate our approach, we use a product line in the automotive domain which is an example that was created in a national project by a leading car company. We have developed a prototype tool named FaMa-OVM, which works as a proof of concepts. We were able to identify void models, dead and false optional elements, and check whether the product line example satisfies quality conditions. {\copyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Software product lines are intended to be used in a long period of time. As a result, they evolve over time, due to the changes in the requirements. Having several individual products in a software family, verification of the entire family may take a considerable effort. In this paper we aim to decrease this cost by reducing the number of verified products using static analysis techniques. Furthermore, to reduce model checking costs after product line evolution, we restrict the number of products that should be re-verified by reusing the previous verification result. All proposed techniques are based on static analysis of the product family model with respect to the property and can be automated. To show the effectiveness of these techniques we apply them on a set of case studies and present the results. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  Abstract                 = {Software Product Line (SPL) testing is challenging due to the potentially huge number of derivable products. To alleviate this problem, numerous contributions have been proposed to reduce the number of products to be tested while still having a good coverage. However, not much attention has been paid to the order in which the products are tested. Test case prioritization techniques reorder test cases to meet a certain performance goal. For instance, testers may wish to order their test cases in order to detect faults as soon as possible, which would translate in faster feedback and earlier fault correction. In this paper, we explore the applicability of test case prioritization techniques to SPL testing. We propose five different prioritization criteria based on common metrics of feature models and we compare their effectiveness in increasing the rate of early fault detection, i.e. a measure of how quickly faults are detected. The results show that different orderings of the same SPL suite may lead to significant differences in the rate of early fault detection. They also show that our approach may contribute to accelerate the detection of faults of SPL test suites based on combinatorial testing. {\copyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Despite their apparent simplicity, the information present in existing PCMs can be very heterogeneous, partial, ambiguous, hard to exploit by users who desire to choose an appropriate product. Variability Models (VMs) can be employed to formulate in a more precise way the semantics of PCMs and enable automated reasoning such as assisted configuration. Yet, the gap between PCMs and VMs should be precisely understood and automated techniques should support the transition between the two. In this paper, we propose variability patterns that describe PCMs content and conduct an empirical analysis of 300+ PCMs mined from Wikipedia. Our findings are a first step toward better engineering techniques for maintaining and configuring PCMs. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

We employ a combination of static and evolutionary learning of model structure, in addition to utilizing a pre-computed solution used as a 'seed' in the midst of a randomly-generated initial population. The seed solution works like a single straw that is enough to break the camel's back -given that it is a feature-rich seed. We show promising results where we can find 30 sound solutions for configuring upward of 6000 features within 30 minutes. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

If the user objective space is rich, then we should use optimizers that can fully exploit that richness. For example, this study configures software product lines (expressed as feature maps) using various search-based software engineering methods. As we increase the number of optimization objectives, we find that methods in widespread use (e.g. NSGA-II, SPEA2) perform much worse than IBEA (Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm). IBEA works best since it makes most use of user preference knowledge. Hence it does better on the standard measures (hypervolume and spread) but it also generates far more products with 0% violations of domain constraints. Our conclusion is that we need to change our methods for search-based software engineering, particularly when studying complex decision spaces. {\copyright} 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose ∆-modelling as an generally applicable variability modelling concept that is orthogonal to model refinement. Products on each modelling level are represented by a core model and a set of ∆- models specifying changes to the core to incorporate product features. Core and ∆-models can be refined independently to obtain a more detailed model of the product line. Based on a formalization of ∆-modelling, we establish conditions that model refinement and model configuration commute resulting in an incremental model-driven development process},

Feature modules are intended to refer to exactly one product feature and can only extend existing implementations. To provide more flexibility for implementing software product lines, we propose delta-oriented programming (DOP) as a novel programming language approach. A product line is represented by a core module and a set of delta modules. The core module provides an implementation of a valid product that can be developed with well-established single application engineering techniques. Delta modules specify changes to be applied to the core module to implement further products by adding, modifying and removing code. Application conditions attached to delta modules allow handling combinations of features explicitly. A product implementation for a particular feature configuration is generated by applying incrementally all delta modules with valid application condition to the core module. In order to evaluate the potential of DOP, we compare it to FOP, both conceptually and empirically.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been shown that product line engineering can significantly improve the productivity, quality and time-to-market of software development by leveraging extensive reuse. Variability models are currently the most advanced approach to define, document and manage the commonalities and variabilities of reusable artifacts such as software components, requirements, test cases, etc. These models provide the basis for automating the derivation of new products and are thus the key artifact to leverage the flexibility and adaptability of systems in a product line. Among the existing approaches to variability modeling feature modeling and decision modeling have gained most importance. A significant amount of research exists on comparing and analyzing different feature modeling approaches. However, despite their significant role in product line research and practical applications, only little effort has been devoted to compare and analyze decision modeling approaches. In order to address this shortcoming and to provide a basis for more structured research on decision modeling in the future, we present a comparative analysis of representative approaches. We identify their major modeling concepts and present an analysis of their commonalities and variabilities. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

to model dependencies between different software product

and correctness of DFMs, we have to apply analyses, such
as dead-feature detection. We discuss why DFMs challenge
the detection of inconsistencies, present how to reuse existing
analyses for DFMs, and propose new analyses to supplement
existing ones. We apply automated analyses in five
steps and evaluate the approach using DFMs specified in

  Abstract                 = {A widespread business model in cloud computing is to offer software as a service (SaaS) over the Internet. Such applications are often multi-tenant aware, which means that multiple tenants share hardware and software resources of the same application instance. However, SaaS stakeholders have different or even contradictious requirements and interests: For a user, the application's quality and non-functional properties have to be maximized (e.g., choosing the fastest available algorithm for a computation at runtime). In contrast, a resource or application provider is interested in minimizing the operating costs while maximizing his profit. Finally, tenants are interested in offering a customized functionality to their users. To identify an optimal compromise for all these objectives, multiple levels of variability have to be supported by reference architectures for multi-tenant SaaS applications. In this paper, we identify requirements for such a runtime architecture addressing the individual interests of all involved stakeholders. Furthermore, we show how our existing architecture for dynamically adaptive applications can be extended for the development and operation of multi-tenant applications. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: The increasing presence of Object-Oriented (OO) programs in industrial systems is progressively drawing the attention of mutation researchers toward this paradigm. However, while the number of research contributions in this topic is plentiful, the number of empirical results is still marginal and mostly provided by researchers rather than practitioners. Objective: This article reports our experience using mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of an automated test data generator from a user perspective. Method: In our study, we applied both traditional and class-level mutation operators to FaMa, an open source Java framework currently being used for research and commercial purposes. We also compared and contrasted our results with the data obtained from some motivating faults found in the literature and two real tools for the analysis of feature models, FaMa and SPLOT. Results: Our results are summarized in a number of lessons learned supporting previous isolated results as well as new findings that hopefully will motivate further research in the field. Conclusion: We conclude that mutation testing is an effective and affordable technique to measure the effectiveness of test mechanisms in OO systems. We found, however, several practical limitations in current tool support that should be addressed to facilitate the work of testers. We also missed specific techniques and tools to apply mutation testing at the system level. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: A feature model (FM) represents the valid combinations of features in a domain. The automated extraction of information from FMs is a complex task that involves numerous analysis operations, techniques and tools. Current testing methods in this context are manual and rely on the ability of the tester to decide whether the output of an analysis is correct. However, this is acknowledged to be time-consuming, error-prone and in most cases infeasible due to the combinatorial complexity of the analyses, this is known as the oracle problem. Objective: In this paper, we propose using metamorphic testing to automate the generation of test data for feature model analysis tools overcoming the oracle problem. An automated test data generator is presented and evaluated to show the feasibility of our approach. Method: We present a set of relations (so-called metamorphic relations) between input FMs and the set of products they represent. Based on these relations and given a FM and its known set of products, a set of neighbouring FMs together with their corresponding set of products are automatically generated and used for testing multiple analyses. Complex FMs representing millions of products can be efficiently created by applying this process iteratively. Results: Our evaluation results using mutation testing and real faults reveal that most faults can be automatically detected within a few seconds. Two defects were found in FaMa and another two in SPLOT, two real tools for the automated analysis of feature models. Also, we show how our generator outperforms a related manual suite for the automated analysis of feature models and how this suite can be used to guide the automated generation of test cases obtaining important gains in efficiency. Conclusion: Our results show that the application of metamorphic testing in the domain of automated analysis of feature models is efficient and effective in detecting most faults in a few seconds without the need for a human oracle. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {A feature model is a compact representation of the products of a software product line. The automated extraction of information from feature models is a thriving topic involving numerous analysis operations, techniques and tools. Performance evaluations in this domain mainly rely on the use of random feature models. However, these only provide a rough idea of the behaviour of the tools with average problems and are not sufficient to reveal their real strengths and weaknesses. In this article, we propose to model the problem of finding computationally hard feature models as an optimization problem and we solve it using a novel evolutionary algorithm for optimized feature models (ETHOM). Given a tool and an analysis operation, ETHOM generates input models of a predefined size maximizing aspects such as the execution time or the memory consumption of the tool when performing the operation over the model. This allows users and developers to know the performance of tools in pessimistic cases providing a better idea of their real power and revealing performance bugs. Experiments using ETHOM on a number of analyses and tools have successfully identified models producing much longer executions times and higher memory consumption than those obtained with random models of identical or even larger size. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {Increasingly, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is becoming a dominant mechanism for the consumption of software by end users. From a vendor's perspective, the benefits of SaaS arise from leveraging economies of scale, by serving a large number of customers ("tenants") through a shared instance of a centrally hosted software service. Consequently, a SaaS provider would, in general, try to drive commonality amongst the requirements of different tenants, and at best, offer a fixed set of customization options. However, many tenants would also come with custom requirements, which may be a pre-requisite for them to adopt the SaaS system. These requirements should then be addressed by evolving the SaaS system in a controlled manner, while still supporting the needs of existing tenants. This need to balance tenant variability and commonality, and to optimize on development and testing effort, can make the evolution of multi-tenant SaaS systems an interesting engineering challenge; this has strong economic undertones as well, given the "pay-per-use" subscription model of SaaS, and the cost of incremental development and maintenance to cater to new tenant needs. In this paper, we outline a set of research issues in the design, testing and maintenance of multi-tenant SaaS systems, and highlight some of the interesting optimization questions that arise in the process. Presenting specific technical solutions is beyond the scope of this paper - instead, our goal is to help shape a research agenda for multi-tenant SaaS that can provide stimulus for further investigation into this area by the software and service engineering research community. {\copyright} 2011 ACM.},

Unfortunately, creating a feature model for an existing project is time-consuming and requires substantial effort from a modeler. We present procedures for reverse engineering feature models based on a crucial heuristic for identifying parents - the major challenge of this task. We also automatically recover constructs such as feature groups, mandatory features, and implies/excludes edges. We evaluate the technique on two large-scale software product lines with existing reference feature models - the Linux and eCos kernels - and FreeBSD, a project without a feature model. Our heuristic is effective across all three projects by ranking the correct parent among the top results for a vast majority of features. The procedures effectively reduce the information a modeler has to consider from thousands of choices to typically five or less. {\copyright} 2011 ACM.},

Concrete products of the family can be generated through a configuration process. The configuration process selects and/or removes features from the feature model according to the stakeholders' requirements. Selecting the right set of features for one product from amongst all of the available features in the feature model is a complex task because: 1) the multiplicity of stakeholders' functional requirements; 2) the positive or negative impact of features on non-functional properties; and 3) the stakeholders' preferences w.r.t. the desirable non-functional properties of the final product. Many configurations techniques have already been proposed to facilitate automated product derivation. However, most of the current proposals are not designed to consider stakeholders' preferences and constraints especially with regard to non-functional properties. We address the software product line configuration problem and propose a framework, which employs an artificial intelligence planning technique to automatically select suitable features that satisfy both the stakeholders' functional and non-functional preferences and constraints. We also provide tooling support to facilitate the use of our framework. Our experiments show that despite the complexity involved with the simultaneous consideration of both functional and non-functional properties our configuration technique is scalable.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose to integrate performance analysis in the early phases of the model-driven development process for Software Product Lines (SPL). We start with a multi-view UML model of the core family assets representing the commonality and variability between different products, which we call the SPL model. We add another perspective to the SPL model, annotating it with generic performance specifications expressed in the standard UML profile MARTE, recently adopted by OMG. The runtime performance of a product is affected by factors contained in the UML model of the product (derived from the SPL model), but also by external factors depending on the implementation and execution environments. The external factors not contained in the SPL model need to be eventually represented in the performance model. In order to do so, we propose to represent the variability space of different possible implementation and execution environments through a so called "performance completion (PC) feature model". These PC features are mapped to MARTE performance-related stereotypes and attributes attached to the SPL model elements. A first model transformation realized in the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) derives the UML model of a specific product with concrete MARTE annotations from the SPL model. A second transformation generates a Layered Queueing Network (LQN) performance model for the given product by applying an existing transformation named PUMA, developed in previous work. The proposed technique is illustrated with an e-commerce case study. A LQN model is derived for a product and the impact of different levels of secure communication channels on its performance is analyzed by using the LQN model. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Software-product-line engineering has gained considerable momentum in recent years, both in industry and in academia. A software product line is a family of software products that share a common set of features. Software product lines challenge traditional analysis techniques, such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving, in their quest of ensuring correctness and reliability of software. Simply creating and analyzing all products of a product line is usually not feasible, due to the potentially exponential number of valid feature combinations. Recently, researchers began to develop analysis techniques that take the distinguishing properties of software product lines into account, for example, by checking feature-related code in isolation or by exploiting variability information during analysis. The emerging field of productline analyses is both broad and diverse, so it is difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand their similarities and differences. We propose a classification of product-line analyses to enable systematic research and application. Based on our insights with classifying and comparing a corpus of 123 research articles, we develop a research agenda to guide future research on product-line analyses. {\copyright} 2014 ACM.},

  Abstract                 = {A software product line is a set of program variants, typically generated from a common code base. Feature models describe variability in product lines by documenting features and their valid combinations. In product-line engineering, we need to reason about variability and program variants for many different tasks. For example, given a feature model, we might want to determine the number of all valid feature combinations or compute specific feature combinations for testing. However, we found that contemporary reasoning approaches can only reason about feature combinations, not about program variants, because they do not take abstract features into account. Abstract features are features used to structure a feature model that, however, do not have any impact at implementation level. Using existing feature-model reasoning mechanisms for program variants leads to incorrect results. Hence, although abstract features represent domain decisions that do not affect the generation of a program variant. We raise awareness of the problem of abstract features for different kinds of analyses on feature models. We argue that, in order to reason about program variants, abstract features should be made explicit in feature models. We present a technique based on propositional formulas that enables to reason about program variants rather than feature combinations. In practice, our technique can save effort that is caused by considering the same program variant multiple times, for example, in product-line testing. {\copyright} 2011 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Context The use of Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) has emerged in the IT arena for the automation of business processes. In the majority of cases, the issue of security is overlooked by default in these systems, and hence the potential cost and consequences of the materialization of threats could produce catastrophic loss for organizations. Therefore, the early selection of security controls that mitigate risks is a real and important necessity. Nevertheless, there exists an enormous range of IT security controls and their configuration is a human, manual, time-consuming and error-prone task. Furthermore, configurations are carried out separately from the organization perspective and involve many security stakeholders. This separation makes difficult to ensure the effectiveness of the configuration with regard to organizational requirements. Objective In this paper, we strive to provide security stakeholders with automated tools for the optimal selection of IT security configurations in accordance with a range of business process scenarios and organizational multi-criteria. Method An approach based on feature model analysis and constraint programming techniques is presented, which enable the automated analysis and selection of optimal security configurations. Results A catalogue of feature models is determined by analyzing typical IT security controls for BPMSs for the enforcement of the standard goals of security: integrity, confidentiality, availability, authorization, and authentication. These feature models have been implemented through constraint programs, and Constraint Programming techniques based on optimized and non-optimized searches are used to automate the selection and generation of configurations. In order to compare the results of the determination of configuration a comparative analysis is given. Conclusion In this paper, we present innovative tools based on feature models, Constraint Programming and multi-objective techniques that enable the agile, adaptable and automatic selection and generation of security configurations in accordance with the needs of the organization. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Engineers thus need support for detecting and resolving inconsistencies. We describe experiences of applying a tool-supported approach for incremental consistency checking on variability models. Our approach significantly improves the overall performance and scalability compared to batch-oriented techniques and allows providing immediate feedback to modelers. It is extensible as new consistency constraints can easily be added. Furthermore, the approach is flexible as it is not limited to variability models and it also checks the consistency of the models with the underlying code base of the product line. We report the results of a thorough evaluation based on real-world product line models and discuss lessons learned.},

As it is often infeasible to analyze each product of a product line individually, researchers have developed analyses, called variability-aware analyses, that consider and exploit variability manifested in a code base. Variabilityaware analyses are often significantly more efficient than traditional analyses, but each of them has certain weaknesses regarding applicability or scalability. We present the Product-Line-Analysis model, a formal model for the classi- fication and comparison of existing analyses, including traditional and variability-aware analyses, and lay a foundation for formulating and exploring further, combined analyses. As a proof of concept, we discuss different examples of analyses in the light of our model, and demonstrate its benefits for systematic comparison and exploration of product-line analyses.},

  Abstract                 = {For the analysis of highly configurable systems, analysis approaches need to take the inherent variability of these systems into account. The notion of presence conditions is central to such approaches. A presence condition specifies a subset of system configurations in which a certain artifact or a concern of interest is present (e.g., a defect associated with this subset). In this paper, we introduce and analyze the problem of presence-condition simplification. A key observation is that presence conditions often contain redundant information, which can be safely removed in the interest of simplicity and efficiency. We present a formalization of the problem, discuss application scenarios, compare different algorithms for solving the problem, and empirically evaluate the algorithms by means of a set of substantial case studies. {\copyright} 2015 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Cost-effective testing of a product in a product line requires obtaining a set of relevant test cases from the entire test suite via test selection and minimization techniques. In this paper, we particularly focus on test minimization for product lines, which identifies and eliminates redundant test cases from test suites in order to reduce the total number of test cases to execute, thereby improving the efficiency of testing. However, such minimization may result in the minimized test suite with low test coverage, low fault revealing capability, low priority test cases, and require more time than the allowed testing budget (e.g., time) as compared to the original test suite. To deal with the above issues, we formulated the minimization problem as a search problem and defined a fitness function considering various optimization objectives based on the above issues. To assess the performance of our fitness function, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation by investigating the fitness function with three weight-based Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and seven multi-objective search algorithms using an industrial case study and 500 artificial problems inspired from the industrial case study. The results show that Random-Weighted Genetic Algorithm (RWGA) significantly outperforms the other algorithms since RWGA can balance all the objectives together by dynamically updating weights during each generation. Based on the results of our empirical evaluation, we also implemented a tool called TEst Minimization using Search Algorithms (TEMSA) to support test minimization using various search algorithms in the context of product lines. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

  Abstract                 = {Software product-lines (SPLs) are software platforms that can be readily reconfigured for different project requirements. A key part of an SPL is a model that captures the rules for reconfiguring the software. SPLs commonly use feature models to capture SPL configuration rules. Each SPL configuration is represented as a selection of features from the feature model. Invalid SPL configurations can be created due to feature conflicts introduced via staged or parallel configuration or changes to the constraints in a feature model. When invalid configurations are created, a method is needed to automate the diagnosis of the errors and repair the feature selections. This paper provides two contributions to research on automated configuration of SPLs. First, it shows how configurations and feature models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems to automatically diagnose errors and repair invalid feature selections. Second, it presents empirical results from diagnosing configuration errors in feature models ranging in size from 100 to 5,000 features. The results of our experiments show that our CSP-based diagnostic technique can scale up to models with thousands of features. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {The increasing complexity and cost of software-intensive systems has led developers to seek ways of reusing software components across development projects. One approach to increasing software reusability is to develop a software product-line (SPL), which is a software architecture that can be reconfigured and reused across projects. Rather than developing software from scratch for a new project, a new configuration of the SPL is produced. It is hard, however, to find a configuration of an SPL that meets an arbitrary requirement set and does not violate any configuration constraints in the SPL. Existing research has focused on techniques that produce a configuration of an SPL in a single step. Budgetary constraints or other restrictions, however, may require multi-step configuration processes. For example, an aircraft manufacturer may want to produce a series of configurations of a plane over a span of years without exceeding a yearly budget to add features. This paper provides three contributions to the study of multi-step configuration for SPLs. First, we present a formal model of multi-step SPL configuration and map this model to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Second, we show how solutions to these SPL configuration problems can be automatically derived with a constraint solver by mapping them to CSPs. Moreover, we show how feature model changes can be mapped to our approach in a multi-step scenario by using feature model drift. Third, we present empirical results demonstrating that our CSP-based reasoning technique can scale to SPL models with hundreds of features and multiple configuration steps. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},
